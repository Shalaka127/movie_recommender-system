# Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)

This project implements a **content-based movie recommendation system** that suggests movies based on textual similarity of movie overviews.  
The system is designed to address the cold-start problem by recommending movies **without relying on user ratings or past user behavior**.

---

## Project Overview

With the rapid growth of online streaming platforms, users often face difficulty choosing movies from large catalogs.  
This project solves the problem by recommending movies using **content-based filtering**, where recommendations are generated by analyzing movie descriptions rather than user interactions.

The system uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Sigmoid Kernel similarity function** to capture deeper semantic relationships between movies.

---

## Objectives

- Merge and preprocess the TMDB 5000 Movies and Credits datasets
- Clean and normalize textual movie data
- Extract features using TF-IDF vectorization
- Compute similarity using the Sigmoid Kernel
- Generate top movie recommendations based on similarity
- Provide an interactive user interface for recommendations
- Visualize popularity, ratings, and similarity metrics

---

## Dataset Used

- **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**
- **TMDB 5000 Credits Dataset**

Key attributes include:
- Movie title
- Overview
- Cast and crew
- Popularity
- Vote count
- Vote average

The datasets are merged using a common movie ID.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Handled missing values in movie overviews
- Normalized popularity and rating values
- Cleaned and prepared text data for analysis

---

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** on movie overviews to convert text into numerical vectors
- This highlights important and rare terms in movie descriptions

---

### 3. Similarity Computation
- Used **Sigmoid Kernel** instead of cosine similarity
- Sigmoid Kernel captures **non-linear semantic relationships**
- Produces similarity values between -1 and 1

---

### 4. Recommendation Generation
- For a selected movie:
  - Compute similarity with all other movies
  - Rank movies based on similarity scores
  - Recommend the top similar movies

---

### 5. Visualization
- Weighted average rating calculation
- Popularity vs rating plots
- Distribution of similarity scores
- Interactive visual analysis

---

## Project Flow (How It Works)

1. User selects a movie title
2. The system processes the movie overview using TF-IDF
3. Sigmoid Kernel computes similarity with other movies
4. Top similar movies are ranked
5. Recommendations are displayed to the user
6. Visual insights are shown using plots

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Python | Core programming language |
| Pandas | Data preprocessing and manipulation |
| NumPy | Numerical computations |
| Scikit-learn | TF-IDF vectorizer and Sigmoid Kernel |
| Plotly / Seaborn | Data visualization |
| Gradio | Interactive user interface |
| Google Colab | Development and experimentation |

---

## How to Run

### Google Colab
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Install required dependencies
3. Upload or link the TMDB datasets
4. Run all cells
5. Select a movie name to get recommendations

---

## Results

- The system successfully recommends movies with similar genres and storylines
- Performs well even for movies with no user ratings
- Sigmoid Kernel provides better semantic matching than linear similarity methods

Example:
- Input: *Iron Man 3*
- Recommendations: *The Avengers*, *Thor*, *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*

---

## Comparative Evaluation

| Approach | Similarity Type | Accuracy | Remark |
|--------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Popularity-Based | Linear | Moderate | Lacks personalization |
| TF-IDF + Cosine | Linear | Good | Limited to linear similarity |
| TF-IDF + Sigmoid | Non-Linear | Excellent | Captures complex semantics |

---

## Limitations

- Does not use collaborative filtering
- Recommendations are based only on content similarity
- User preferences and feedback are not considered

---

## Future Enhancements

- Hybrid recommendation system (content + collaborative filtering)
- Use deep learning embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT)
- Deploy as a web application
- Add multilingual support
- Improve recommendation explainability
